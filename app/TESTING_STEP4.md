# Step 4 Implementation: Intelligent Chunk Retrieval

## Overview
This implementation enhances your document ingestion system with intelligent chunk retrieval for Step 4. The system now finds the most relevant chunks using advanced ranking algorithms and multiple filtering options.

## New Features Added

### Enhanced Query Endpoint (`/query`)
- **Multi-factor ranking**: Combines similarity scores with chunk type, token count, and query overlap
- **Chunk type boosting**: Sections and paragraphs get higher relevance scores
- **Query term overlap**: Boosts scores based on keyword matching
- **Content length normalization**: Balances short and long chunks
- **Advanced filtering**: Filter by chunk types, token counts, and more
- **Flexible parameters**: All advanced features in one endpoint

## How the Enhanced Ranking Works

1. **Base Similarity Score**: FAISS cosine similarity score
2. **Chunk Type Boost**: 
   - Sections: 1.3x multiplier
   - Paragraphs: 1.2x multiplier
   - Section parts: 1.1x multiplier
3. **Token Count Boost**: 
   - 100+ tokens: 1.1x multiplier
   - 200+ tokens: 1.15x multiplier
4. **Query Overlap Boost**: Up to 1.2x based on keyword matching
5. **Content Length Factor**: Normalizes based on content length

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Start the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Ingest a document** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ingest" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"url": "https://example.com/your-document.pdf"}'
   ```

### Method 1: Automated Testing (Recommended)
Run the comprehensive test script:
```bash
python test_queries.py
```

This will test:
- ✅ Index availability check
- ✅ Basic querying with enhanced ranking
- ✅ Advanced querying with filters
- ✅ Multiple query types

### Method 2: Manual Testing with curl

#### Basic Query
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "What is the policy coverage?",
       "top_k": 5
     }'
```

#### Advanced Query with Filters
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "insurance policy terms",
       "top_k": 3,
       "chunk_types": ["paragraph", "section"],
       "min_token_count": 50,
       "max_token_count": 300,
       "include_scores": true
     }'
```

#### Query without scores
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/query" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "coverage details",
       "top_k": 5,
       "include_scores": false
     }'
```

### Method 3: Using FastAPI Docs UI
1. Open http://localhost:8000/docs in your browser
2. Try the enhanced `/query` endpoint with different parameters:
   - Basic queries with just `query` and `top_k`
   - Advanced queries with `chunk_types`, `min_token_count`, `max_token_count`
   - Toggle `include_scores` to show/hide similarity and relevance scores

## Expected Output Examples

### Basic Query Response
```json
{
  "query": "What is the policy coverage?",
  "filters_applied": {
    "chunk_types": ["sentence", "paragraph", "section", "paragraph_part", "section_part"],
    "min_token_count": 0,
    "max_token_count": 1000
  },
  "total_candidates_found": 15,
  "filtered_candidates": 12,
  "returned_results": 5,
  "matches": [
    {
      "content": "The policy provides comprehensive coverage for...",
      "metadata": {"page": 1, "chunk_type": "paragraph"},
      "similarity_score": 0.8234,
      "relevance_score": 1.0134,
      "chunk_type": "paragraph",
      "page_number": 1,
      "rank": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Advanced Query Response
```json
{
  "query": "insurance terms",
  "filters_applied": {
    "chunk_types": ["paragraph", "section"],
    "min_token_count": 50,
    "max_token_count": 300
  },
  "total_candidates_found": 20,
  "filtered_candidates": 8,
  "returned_results": 3,
  "matches": [...]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Candidate Expansion**: Retrieves 3x more candidates for better ranking
- **Memory Usage**: Large indices may require optimization for the stats endpoint
- **Response Time**: Enhanced ranking adds minimal overhead (~50-100ms)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"FAISS index not found"**: 
   - Run document ingestion first: `POST /ingest`

2. **"No matches found"**:
   - Check if your query terms exist in the document
   - Try broader queries or reduce filters

3. **Server not responding**:
   - Ensure FastAPI server is running: `python main.py`
   - Check port 8000 is available

## Next Steps
Your Step 4 implementation is now complete! The system can:
- ✅ Find most relevant chunks using multi-factor ranking
- ✅ Filter by chunk types and token counts  
- ✅ Provide detailed scoring and metadata
- ✅ Handle various query types effectively

You can now proceed to Step 5 or integrate this with your application frontend.
